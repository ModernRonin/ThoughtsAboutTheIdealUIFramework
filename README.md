Problem: 

Non of the existing UI frameworks/philosophies - MVC, MVVM, MVU etc. - fulfills all of the following requirements:
* allow creation/maintenance of the actual UI by a non-programmer completely
* separate properly between code that serves only UI specifics (for example, expanding/collapsing a treenode or a panel, or defining what selection means in a given context) from code that has to do with the domain directly or indirectly (eg, calls to a server)
